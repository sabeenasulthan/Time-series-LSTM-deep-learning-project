# Time Series Forecasting with LSTM and Uncertainty Quantification

## 📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on *time series forecasting* using a deep learning model (LSTM) along with *uncertainty estimation* using Monte Carlo Dropout.  
The aim is not only to predict future values accurately but also to quantify prediction uncertainty.

The project compares traditional statistical forecasting (ARIMA) with a deep learning approach (LSTM) and evaluates forecast reliability using confidence intervals.
